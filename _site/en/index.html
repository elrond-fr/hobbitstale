    A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.  Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
 (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification 
 of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
  without alteration of all subsequent blocks.

  <dt id="dlt">Distributed ledger technology (DLT)</dt>
  <dd>
    A distributed ledger technology is simply a decentralized database managed by multiple participants. It records transaction history across nodes in a decentralized manner. Each node validates and records transactions simultaneously. Each record has a unique time stamp and must be cryptographically signed to ensure the security and incorruptibility of the network.

  <dd>
    Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in  throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations:  a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure <a href="pos">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> algorithm,  enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism.  Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency,  and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible
 internet economy.

  <dt id="encryption">Encryption</dt>
  <dd>
    Encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information,  known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.  Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.

  <dt id="pos">Proof of Stake (PoS)</dt>
  <dd>
    Proof-of-stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus algorithm to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW).
 Unlike mining, which requires massive electrical power to validate transactions, staking is a
  more eco-friendly process.

  <dt id="sharding">Sharding</dt>
  <dd>
    Sharding was first used in databases and is a method for distributing data across multiple machines.  This makes it a scaling technique, and can be used by blockchain networks to partition states and transaction processing,
 so that each node of the network would only need to process a fraction of all the transactions. Moreover, sharding allows for the parallel processing of transactions.
  As long as there is a sufficient number of nodes verifying each transaction, ensuring high reliability and security,
   then splitting a blockchain into shards will allow it to process far more transactions by means of parallelization, 
   and thus greatly improving transaction throughput and efficiency. Moreover, sharding promises to increase the throughput of the network
    as it expands and the number of validator grows - a property called horizontal scaling.

  <dt id="staking">Staking</dt>
  <dd>
    Staking is the process of holding funds in a crypto <a href="wallet">wallet</a> to support the operations
 of a blockchain network. Basically, it involves locking up one’s crypto assets to receive rewards.

  <dt id="wallet">Wallet</dt>
  <dd>
    A wallet, or digital wallet, is a software or hardware application that stores private keys and allows
 users to interact with the blockchain. Cryptocurrency wallets are classified into 
 two main categories: hot wallets, and cold wallets. 
 Wallets can be used to send and receive coins, as well as review balances.
