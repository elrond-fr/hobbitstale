      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks.

      A distributed ledger technology is simply a decentralized database managed by multiple participants. It records transaction history across nodes in a decentralized manner. Each node validates and records transactions simultaneously. Each record has a unique time stamp and must be cryptographically signed to ensure the security and incorruptibility of the network.
